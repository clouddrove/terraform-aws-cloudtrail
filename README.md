We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.13](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cloudtrail/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
    module "cloudtrail" {
      source                        = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cloudtrail.git?ref=tags/0.12.5"
      name                          = "cloudtrail"
      application                   = "clouddrove"
      environment                   = "security"
      label_order                   = ["environment", "name", "application"]
      s3_bucket_name                = "s3-logs"
      enable_logging                = true
      enable_log_file_validation    = true
      include_global_service_events = true
      is_multi_region_trail         = false
      kms_key_id                    = "arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:xxxxxxxxx:key/xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxx"
    }
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| application | Application \(e.g. `cd` or `clouddrove`\). | string | `""` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes \(e.g. `1`\). | list(string) | `<list>` | no |
| cloud\_watch\_logs\_group\_arn | Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\), that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs will be delivered. | string | `""` | no |
| cloud\_watch\_logs\_role\_arn | Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to write to a user’s log group. | string | `""` | no |
| enable\_log\_file\_validation | Specifies whether log file integrity validation is enabled. Creates signed digest for validated contents of logs. | bool | `"true"` | no |
| enable\_logging | Enable logging for the trail. | bool | `"true"` | no |
| enabled\_cloudtrail | If true, deploy the resources for the module. | bool | `"true"` | no |
| environment | Environment \(e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`\). | string | `""` | no |
| event\_selector | Specifies an event selector for enabling data event logging, It needs to be a list of map values. See: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/cloudtrail.html for details on this map variable. | list(string) | `<list>` | no |
| include\_global\_service\_events | Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from global services such as IAM to the log files. | bool | `"false"` | no |
| is\_multi\_region\_trail | Specifies whether the trail is created in the current region or in all regions. | bool | `"false"` | no |
| is\_organization\_trail | The trail is an AWS Organizations trail. | bool | `"false"` | no |
| kms\_key\_id | Specifies the KMS key ARN to use to encrypt the logs delivered by CloudTrail. | string | `""` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | list | `<list>` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove' or 'AnmolNagpal'. | string | `"anmol@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  \(e.g. `app` or `cluster`\). | string | n/a | yes |
| s3\_bucket\_name | S3 bucket name for CloudTrail log. | string | n/a | yes |
| tags | Additional tags \(e.g. map\(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`\). | map(string) | `<map>` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| arn | The Amazon Resource Name of the trail. |
| home\_region | The region in which the trail was created. |
| id | The name of the trail. |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
